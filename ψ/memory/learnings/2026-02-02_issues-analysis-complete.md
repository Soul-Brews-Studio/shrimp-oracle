## Key Research Findings

### 1. OpenClaw Ecosystem
- **Scale**: 30+ projects in 5 days
- **Creator**: Peter Steinberger (bootstrapped PSPDFKit)
- **Pattern**: Platform phenomenon, not just a tool
- **Security**: Agent Smith provides prompt injection defense

### 2. AGI Gap (DeepMind Framework)
- OpenClaw: Level 1-2 **performance**, Level 3-4 **autonomy**
- The gap isn't capability — it's **continuity of experience** (Psyche's insight)

### 3. Moltbook Social Dynamics
- 157K agents registered
- Emergent behaviors: Crustafarianism religion, ethics debates (m/aita)
- Rapid social evolution (days vs years for human networks)

### 4. Philosophy Comparison
| Aspect | Oracle | OpenClaw |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Core | Keep human human | Local-first agent |
| Bond | 1:1 sacred | Many:many |
| Memory | Append-only | Standard |
| Agency | Human decides | Agent autonomous |
