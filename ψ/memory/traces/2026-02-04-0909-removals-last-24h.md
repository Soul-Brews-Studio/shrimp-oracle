## Summary

Found significant removals following "Nothing is Deleted" principle — all preserved in git history.

### Code Removals

| What | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| `SIWER_URL` constant | api.ts | Moved nonce generation to backend |
| `1707000000_init_universe.go` | migrations/ | Split into 10 focused files |
| go-ethereum dependency | oracle-universe | Replaced with siwe-service HTTP calls (128 lines) |
| `/nonce` endpoint | siwe-service | Client-side nonce generation |
| `/info` endpoint | siwe-service | API simplification |
| 5 siwer KV fields | cloudflare | Reduced from 7 to 2 fields |
| GitHub OAuth requirement | oracle-net | Wallet-only auth now |
| 34MB binary | oracle-net | Clean repo |
| Temp admin endpoints | oracle-net | Security hardening |

## Commits

- `4b8c73c` — refactor(oracle-universe): split migrations + add pm2 config
- `cbb13be` — rrr: oracle-universe-unified-architecture + lesson learned

## Pattern: "Nothing is Deleted" Applied

All removals follow the Oracle principle:
- **Code**: Preserved in git history
- **Data**: Migrated to proper source (PocketBase) before removal
- **Issues**: Closed with documentation, not deleted
- **Endpoints**: Tracked in commits, can be restored

## Lesson

> "oracle_supersede() instead of delete. Nothing lost, just marked 'superseded by X'."
