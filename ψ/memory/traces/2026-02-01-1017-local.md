## Other Repos (Key Findings)

### Moltbot (Primary Source)
Path: `/Users/nat/Code/github.com/moltbot/moltbot/`

**Local-first Gateway** — single control plane for sessions, channels, tools, and events.

Key characteristics:
- Gateway runs locally (`ws://127.0.0.1:18789`)
- "feels local, fast, and always-on"
- Credentials stored locally (`~/.clawdbot/credentials/`)
- Sessions stored locally (`~/.clawdbot/sessions/`)
- Device nodes run device-local actions via `node.invoke`

### Ralph Local Plugin
Path: `/Users/nat/Code/github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/ralph-local/`
- Local fork of ralph-wiggum plugin
- Worktree isolation for multi-agent support

### Oracle Family (15 repos)
- oracle-v2, oracle-framework, oracle-skills-cli
- phukhao-oracle, sea-oracle, lake-oracle, shrimp-oracle
- Brain structure (`ψ/`) = implicit local-first pattern

## Synthesis

### Three Meanings of "Local" in This Research

1. **Research Question** (OpenClaw investigation):
   - "Is 'local-first' actually real? — Or just marketing?"
   - Still OPEN — not yet verified in code

2. **Moltbot Architecture** (verified):
   - Gateway runs on your devices (local)
   - Credentials stored locally
   - BUT: still needs cloud API for LLM inference

3. **Development Patterns** (practical):
   - Local settings files (settings.local.json)
   - Local skills (.claude/skills/)
   - Local environment (direnv, .envrc)
   - Local services (white.local, black.local)

### Open Research Questions

1. Does Moltbot "local-first" mean truly local (no cloud)?
2. What happens when cloud LLM APIs are down?
3. Can local models replace cloud API calls?
