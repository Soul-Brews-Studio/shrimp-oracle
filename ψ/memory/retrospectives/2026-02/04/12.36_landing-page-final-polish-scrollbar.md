# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-04
**Start Time**: 12:16 GMT+7
**End Time**: 12:36 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Landing Page Final Polish - Scrollbar Fix
**Session Type**: Bug Fix + Final Polish
**Branch**: agents/1

## Session Summary

Short session focused on final polish for the Oracle Universe landing page. Implemented the plan from previous session, discovered the "View Dashboard" link was already removed. User spotted the ugly scrollbar on the scroll-snap slideshow, used `/trace` to find existing CSS class, and applied the fix.

## Timeline
- 12:16 - Started session, read plan from handoff
- 12:18 - Read Landing.tsx, found "View Dashboard" already removed
- 12:20 - Started dev server, verified landing page in browser
- 12:22 - User spotted scrollbar issue, ran /trace to find solution
- 12:24 - Found `hide-scrollbar` class in index.css, applied to scroll container
- 12:28 - Verified all 4 slides work correctly, no scrollbar visible
- 12:32 - Committed scrollbar fix
- 12:34 - User requested commit all, committed 103 files (unified architecture + archive)
- 12:36 - Session wrap-up

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
apps/oracle-universe/web/src/pages/Landing.tsx (+1 line - hide-scrollbar class)
```

### Key Code Changes
- **Landing.tsx:419**: Added `hide-scrollbar` class to scroll-snap container
  ```tsx
  <div className="h-screen overflow-y-auto snap-y snap-mandatory bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-950 via-slate-950 to-slate-900 hide-scrollbar">
  ```

### Architecture Decisions
- Reused existing `.hide-scrollbar` CSS class from index.css instead of writing new CSS
- Pattern: Check for existing utilities before creating new ones

## AI Diary

This was a satisfying quick-win session. I came in with a clear plan from the previous handoff, expecting to remove the "View Dashboard" link and verify the landing page. When I read the code, I found the link was already gone - the previous session had already cleaned it up.

The real learning came when Nat spotted the scrollbar. At first I just scrolled through the slides to verify they looked good, not noticing the scrollbar. User feedback is invaluable - they see things differently than I do when I'm focused on specific code changes.

Using `/trace` to find the solution was the right call. Oracle search didn't have exact matches for "scrollbar hiding," but the local grep found the existing `.hide-scrollbar` class immediately. This reinforces the principle: before creating new solutions, search for existing ones. The CSS was already there in `index.css` - someone had anticipated this need.

The final commit of 103 files felt like a major milestone. We've archived the old `agent-net` and `oracle-net` apps, committing to the unified `oracle-universe` architecture. Nothing is deleted - they live in `apps/_archive/` for reference.

## What Went Well
- Quick session with clear deliverable
- Used existing CSS utility instead of writing new code
- User caught scrollbar issue I missed - good collaboration
- Clean commit history with semantic messages

## What Could Improve
- Should have noticed the scrollbar during initial visual verification
- Could have checked for hide-scrollbar usage in other files first

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Mobile responsive test failed (resize_window didn't work on MacOS)
  **Resolution**: MacOS has minimum window sizes, would need DevTools device emulation

## Honest Feedback

This session was efficient - 20 minutes for a focused fix. The scroll-snap slideshow UX is now much cleaner without the distracting scrollbar.

The `/trace` skill worked well for this use case - even though Oracle didn't have exact matches, the auto-escalation to local search found the solution quickly. The hybrid approach (Oracle + local grep) is powerful.

One friction point: browser automation for responsive testing is limited. The `resize_window` tool couldn't resize below MacOS minimum, so I couldn't properly test 375px mobile viewport. For true responsive testing, we'd need DevTools device emulation or actual mobile testing.

### Friction Points
1. **Scrollbar not noticed**: I was focused on content/layout and missed the scrollbar. Need to check entire viewport, not just content area.
2. **Mobile testing limitations**: Browser resize doesn't work for small viewports on MacOS. Need alternative approach.
3. **Plan accuracy**: Plan said to remove "View Dashboard" but it was already gone. Plans can become stale between sessions.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Check existing CSS utilities before creating new ones - `hide-scrollbar` was already there
- **Mistake**: Focused only on content verification, missed viewport-level issues like scrollbar
- **Discovery**: Scroll-snap + hide-scrollbar = clean slideshow UX

## Next Steps
- [ ] Explore backend code structure for user
- [ ] Test on actual mobile device if needed
- [ ] Consider creating PR for agents/1 branch

## Metrics
- **Commits**: 2 (scrollbar fix + full commit)
- **Files changed**: 103 (mostly renames to _archive)
- **Lines added**: ~2311
- **Lines removed**: ~1590
- **Session duration**: 20 minutes
