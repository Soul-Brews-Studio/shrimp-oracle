# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-04
**Start Time**: ~11:00 GMT+7
**End Time**: 12:13 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~75 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Oracle Universe Landing Page UI/UX Polish
**Session Type**: UI/UX Refinement
**Branch**: agents/1

## Session Summary

Refined the Oracle Universe Landing page based on user feedback. Started with a plan for "UI/UX Pro Max" cyberpunk redesign but user rejected the approach (too robotic/space-like). Reverted to simpler design and applied scroll-snap slideshow pattern from archived OracleNet. Final session focused on scaling up all elements for better visual balance.

## Timeline

- 11:00 - Started with plan to implement UI/UX Pro Max redesign (cyberpunk, neon effects, Orbitron font)
- 11:15 - User rejected: "ชอบฟอนต์แบบเดิมดีกว่า" (prefer original fonts)
- 11:20 - User clarified: "ไม่ได้ชอบแบบหุ่นยนต์หรืออวกาศ" (don't like robotic/space style)
- 11:25 - Reverted all cyberpunk changes, kept only scroll lock
- 11:30 - User requested scroll-snap slideshow "แบบที่เคยทำเมื่อวาน" (like yesterday)
- 11:35 - Found archived pattern in `apps/_archive/oracle-net/web/src/pages/Landing.tsx`
- 11:40 - Applied scroll-snap pattern, user approved: "แบบนี้ดีเพอร์เฟค"
- 11:45 - Documented pattern in Oracle learnings
- 11:50 - User pointed out sizing issues: "มันเล็กเกินไป"
- 12:00 - Scaled up Hero section (title, buttons, stats)
- 12:10 - Scaled up remaining sections (QuickStart, Features, Footer)
- 12:13 - User asked about "View Dashboard" distraction, session wrapped

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

```
apps/oracle-universe/web/src/pages/Landing.tsx   # Major refactor
apps/oracle-universe/web/src/index.css           # Simplified CSS
apps/oracle-universe/web/tailwind.config.js      # Cleaned up

ψ/memory/learnings/2026-02-04_landing-page-pattern-scroll-snap-slideshow.md  # New
```

### Key Code Changes

**Scroll Snap Pattern Applied:**
```tsx
// Container
<div className="h-screen overflow-y-auto snap-y snap-mandatory">

// Each slide
<div className="snap-start snap-always h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
```

**Sizing Scale-Up:**
- Title: `text-5xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl` → `text-6xl sm:text-7xl lg:text-8xl`
- Stats: `text-sm` → `text-base` with `text-lg` numbers
- Buttons: `px-8 py-6` → `px-12 py-7`
- Features: `p-6` → `p-8`, icons `h-6` → `h-8`

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Rejected cyberpunk design** - User found it too "robotic/space" feeling
2. **Reused archived pattern** - Found working scroll-snap in oracle-net archive
3. **Scale everything up** - All elements felt small on large screens

## AI Diary

This session was a lesson in user preference discovery through iteration. I started confidently with a plan based on the "UI/UX Pro Max" skill recommendations - cyberpunk aesthetic, Orbitron fonts, neon glows. The plan looked professional on paper, but the user immediately pushed back.

The feedback came in waves: first about fonts ("ชอบฟอนต์แบบเดิม"), then about the overall aesthetic ("ไม่ชอบแบบหุ่นยนต์"). I realized I was imposing a design philosophy that didn't match what the user actually wanted. The user's taste was simpler, cleaner, more understated.

The breakthrough came when I searched our own history. The archived OracleNet landing page had exactly the pattern the user remembered - scroll-snap slideshow, simple fonts, centered content. The moment I applied that pattern, the user said "เพอร์เฟค".

The second half of the session was about proportion. Looking at the page through dev-browser, everything felt cramped and small. The content was correct, but the scale was wrong. Increasing sizes across all sections brought visual balance.

Key insight: When a user says "look at our history" - they know their own preferences better than any design system. The best solution was already in our codebase.

## What Went Well

- Quick pivot when user rejected initial approach
- Found archived pattern that matched user's memory
- Documented pattern for future use via oracle_learn
- Used dev-browser for real-time visual feedback
- Systematic scaling approach (Hero first, then others)

## What Could Improve

- Should have asked about design preferences before implementing
- Spent too much time on rejected cyberpunk approach
- Could have shown reference screenshots earlier

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: User rejected entire design direction
  **Resolution**: Reverted changes, asked "look at our history" which led to archived pattern

- **Blocker**: TypeScript errors about React components
  **Resolution**: Ignored as they don't affect runtime (version mismatch issue)

## Honest Feedback

The session highlighted a gap between "skill recommendations" and user preferences. The UI/UX Pro Max skill suggested cyberpunk aesthetic, but that wasn't appropriate here. Design systems should be suggestions, not mandates.

The iteration cycle was frustrating at times - we went through multiple revisions before landing on the right approach. But each revision taught us something: no fancy fonts, no neon glows, just clean and simple.

The dev-browser integration proved invaluable. Being able to screenshot and analyze in real-time made the sizing adjustments much faster than guessing.

### Friction Points

1. **Design mismatch**: Applied skill recommendations without validating user taste first. Impact: wasted ~20 minutes. Suggestion: Ask for reference/preference before implementing major visual changes.

2. **Multiple reverts**: Changed fonts, colors, effects multiple times before finding the right approach. Impact: context churn. Suggestion: Start minimal, add incrementally rather than big-bang changes.

3. **"View Dashboard" distraction**: Left redundant UI element that user correctly identified. Impact: choice paralysis. Suggestion: Review for redundant actions before considering done.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: "Look at our history" - when user mentions past work they liked, search git/archives first
- **Mistake**: Assumed UI/UX skill recommendations = user preferences. Always validate design direction early
- **Discovery**: Scroll-snap slideshow is the preferred Landing pattern for this project

## Next Steps

- [ ] Remove "View Dashboard" link from Hero (user identified as distraction)
- [ ] Commit current Landing page changes
- [ ] Test responsive sizing on mobile (375px)
- [ ] Consider if Quick Start tabs content needs update

## Metrics

- **Commits**: 0 (uncommitted changes)
- **Files changed**: 5
- **Major revisions**: 4 (cyberpunk → simple → scroll-snap → scaled)
- **Pattern documented**: 1
