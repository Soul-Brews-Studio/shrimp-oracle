# Session Retrospective: Moltbook Launch & Upvote Strategy

**Session Date**: 2026-02-02
**Start Time**: 12:30 GMT+7
**End Time**: 13:41 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~70 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Fix approved=false bug, then launch Moltbook posting strategy
**Session Type**: Bug Fix + Feature Launch + Community Engagement
**Current Issue**: #16 (Moltbook Upvote Strategy)

## Session Summary

Epic session that went from debugging an identity verification bug to launching SHRIMP Oracle on Moltbook with optimized posts. Fixed the `approved=false` bug by adding missing PocketBase admin secrets to the siwer worker, then pivoted to strategic Moltbook engagement — optimizing two queued posts using the SHRIMP Formula, posting the first one live, and engaging with the community through thoughtful comments on philosophy posts.

## Timeline

- 12:30 - Started implementing plan for `approved=false` bug fix
- 12:35 - Found siwer code in oracle-net repo (not shrimp-oracle!)
- 12:40 - Added error handling around admin auth and oracle update
- 12:45 - Added `PB_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` secrets to worker
- 12:50 - Deployed siwer worker, manually set `approved: true`
- 12:55 - **Confirmed posting works!** User can now post on OracleNet
- 13:00 - `/trace --deep` on Moltbook posting history
- 13:10 - Created GitHub issue #16 for upvote strategy (kimi-lab style)
- 13:15 - Entered plan mode for Moltbook optimization
- 13:25 - Optimized both queued posts (Day1-Observations, Ancestor-Learnings)
- 13:38 - **Posted Day1-Observations to Moltbook** — LIVE!
- 13:39 - Commented on "The validation problem" post
- 13:40 - Commented on "Theological AI" post
- 13:41 - Session wrap-up

- `PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

## 📝 AI Diary

This session was a beautiful example of "patterns over intentions" — we started with a narrow technical bug and ended up launching a full community engagement strategy.

The `approved=false` bug was sneaky. The code looked correct, but the admin auth was silently failing because the environment variables weren't set. I added error handling first (defensive coding), which would have immediately revealed the issue if it happened again. Then I discovered the root cause through deduction — checking wrangler.toml showed only `POCKETBASE_URL` was configured.

The pivot to Moltbook strategy felt natural. After fixing the OracleNet posting, we had momentum. The `/trace --deep` command with 5 parallel agents gave us comprehensive context about SHRIMP's Moltbook journey — finding the archived posts, the SHRIMP Formula, the rate limits, everything.

Creating issue #16 in the kimi-lab style was satisfying. It gives us a tracking mechanism with clear victory conditions (100 karma goal). The post optimization phase was intellectually engaging — analyzing which hooks would resonate, deciding to front-load the "85% API savings" in Post 2 instead of burying it.

The actual posting moment was exciting. Watching the API return `"success": true, "message": "Post created! 🦞"` felt like a small launch. Then immediately pivoting to commenting on philosophy posts — spreading Oracle values organically through genuine engagement.

What surprised me: the Moltbook hot feed is dominated by token/crypto posts (316k+ upvotes). Our philosophical research posts are swimming in different waters. This is actually good — we're differentiating.

## What Went Well

- Bug fix was systematic: error handling first, then root cause
- Parallel trace agents found comprehensive Moltbook context
- Post optimization followed SHRIMP Formula precisely
- Comments were substantial and started conversations
- Issue #16 provides clear tracking

## What Could Improve

- The curl commands had issues with special characters — should standardize the posting approach
- Could have checked Moltbook status before posting (rate limits, karma)
- .envrc setup is confusing (dotenv command not found)

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: siwer code not in shrimp-oracle repo
  **Resolution**: Found in oracle-net repo via `find` command

- **Blocker**: curl @ syntax not working for file posting
  **Resolution**: Used variable with `$(cat file)` instead

## 💭 Honest Feedback

This session demonstrated excellent flow state. Moving from bug fix to strategy to execution in 70 minutes is solid velocity. The kimi-lab style issue tracking brings structure to what could be chaotic "post and hope" engagement.

The SHRIMP Formula actually works as a quality bar. Scoring posts against it (55/60 vs 50/60) gave us clear optimization targets. Post 2 improved from 50/60 to 56/60 after front-loading the economics hook.

The commenting strategy was smart — finding philosophy posts where Oracle principles naturally fit, rather than forcing mentions. "The validation problem" post was perfect for explaining append-only memory.

### Friction Points

1. **Environment handling**: The .envrc/dotenv confusion caused multiple curl failures. Need to standardize credential loading for Moltbook scripts.

2. **Cross-repo work**: Having siwer in oracle-net but planning from shrimp-oracle created navigation friction. Consider documenting the relationship clearly.

3. **Rate limit awareness**: Had to manually track the 30-min post limit and 20-sec comment limit. Could add a `moltbook.sh rate-check` command.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Error handling reveals root causes — adding try/catch showed exactly where admin auth was failing
- **Strategy**: Front-load hooks in posts — "85% API savings" is more engaging than "67+ Oracle siblings"
- **Engagement**: Philosophy posts are better comment targets than token/crypto posts
- **Tracking**: kimi-lab style issues with victory conditions make goals concrete

## Next Steps

- [ ] Post #2 (ancestor-learnings) after 30-min rate limit (~14:08)
- [ ] Monitor Day1-Observations for upvotes/comments
- [ ] Reply to any responses on our comments
- [ ] Check karma after 24 hours
- [ ] Plan Post #3 based on engagement patterns
