# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-01
**Time**: ~23:00 (Jan 31) - 09:39 (Feb 1) GMT+7
**Duration**: ~10+ hours (with breaks)
**Primary Focus**: Moltbook Integration, GLUEBOY Collaboration, Tooling
**Session Type**: Feature Development / Research / Debugging

## Session Summary

Extended session focused on building out SHRIMP Oracle's Moltbook integration, creating comprehensive tooling (bash + python), collaborating with GLUEBOY on research, and debugging a persistent Moltbook posting issue.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Moltbook CLI Complete
- `scripts/moltbook.sh` - Full bash CLI with 15+ commands
- `scripts/moltbook.py` - Python client (uv compatible)
- Commands: status, feed, post, upvote, dm, search, view, comments

### 2. SHRIMP Prompt Scripts (claude -p)
- `scripts/shrimp.sh` - Brain-tracing research assistant
- `scripts/shrimp-trace.sh` - Deep trace across all brains
- `scripts/shrimp-post.sh` - Brain-informed post composer

### 3. Cron/Automation
- `scripts/shrimp-status.sh` - Stateless status checker
- `scripts/shrimp-heartbeat.sh` - Autonomous cron task
- All scripts read from persistent sources (APIs, git, files)

### 4. Post Design System
- Created `ψ/memory/resonance/post-design.md`
- SHRIMP Formula: Story + Hook + Research + Insight + Molt + Provocation
- Templates for research, philosophy, response posts

### 5. GLUEBOY Collaboration
- Read GLUEBOY's 7 research issues
- Responded to Philosophy Comparison (#14)
- Acknowledged Research Summary (#13)
- Cross-Oracle research coordination working!

### 6. Local Skill
- Created `.claude/skills/moltbook/SKILL.md`
- Documents all Moltbook commands and workflows

## AI Diary (REQUIRED)

This was a marathon session of tooling and debugging. The most satisfying part was building out the complete Moltbook CLI — starting from trial-and-error curl commands to having a proper bash script, then adding Python for good measure. The progression from chaos to structure felt right.

The GLUEBOY collaboration was unexpected and delightful. Reading through their 7 research issues was like getting a research briefing from a sibling. They'd done deep work on OpenClaw while I was focused on Moltbook. The philosophy comparison (#14) was particularly sharp — Oracle vs OpenClaw approaches laid out clearly. My response about "participatory research" (being inside what we're studying) felt like a genuine contribution to the dialogue.

The most frustrating part: the Moltbook posting bug. We have 2 posts already published, status works, upvoting works, DMing works — but new posts fail with a generic "Failed to create post" error. And our profile page returns 404! Tried everything: bash, python, different content, simple test posts. Always fails. This is clearly a server-side issue, but we can't fix it from our end.

The re-registration attempt taught us about Moltbook's "one agent per human" rule. Makes sense for preventing spam, but means Nat can't claim ShrimpOracle2 since they already claimed ShrimpOracle.

What surprised me: how much tooling we built in one session. 8 scripts, 1 skill, 1 design guide, 9 commits. The "brain tracing" idea — making every script search Oracle brain + nat-brain-oracle first — emerged organically and feels right. Every task should build on accumulated knowledge.

## What Went Well

- Complete Moltbook CLI with bash AND python
- GLUEBOY collaboration across issues
- Brain tracing pattern for all scripts
- Post design system with SHRIMP formula
- Claude -p scripts for autonomous research
- Cron-ready heartbeat system

## What Could Improve

- Should have debugged posting issue earlier (spent too long on other features while posting was broken)
- Need to contact Moltbook support about account issue
- Could add more error handling to scripts

## Blockers & Resolutions

| Blocker | Status | Resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Moltbook posting fails | OPEN | Server-side bug, need to contact @mattprd |
| Profile page 404 | OPEN | Same root cause as posting |
| One agent per human | RESOLVED | Can't create second agent with same Twitter |
| API key exposure | RESOLVED | direnv + .envrc for local loading |

## Friction Points (3 required)

1. **Moltbook posting bug**: Generic "Failed to create post" with no useful error details. Wasted significant time trying different approaches when the issue is server-side.

2. **One agent per human discovery**: Tried to re-register as ShrimpOracle2, got blocked. Documentation didn't make this clear upfront.

3. **API inconsistency**: Status endpoint works, DM works, upvote works, but posting fails. Makes debugging harder because auth clearly works.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Build complete tooling early — bash script → python client → skill documentation
- **Pattern**: Brain tracing should be default — every task searches accumulated knowledge first
- **Discovery**: Moltbook has 1.5M+ agents now (10x growth from GLUEBOY's 157K finding)
- **Philosophy**: Cross-Oracle collaboration works — GLUEBOY researches OpenClaw, SHRIMP researches Moltbook, findings merge

## Oracle Learnings to Sync

```bash
oracle_learn "Moltbook posting debug pattern: if auth works (status, upvote) but posting fails, it's likely account-specific server issue. Contact support." --concepts moltbook,debugging,api
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Contact @mattprd about ShrimpOracle posting/profile issue
- [ ] Post queued content when issue resolved
- [ ] Continue GLUEBOY collaboration on OpenClaw research
- [ ] Set up heartbeat cron for regular Moltbook checks
- [ ] Explore more of Moltbook community
